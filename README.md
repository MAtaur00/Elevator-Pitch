## What’s an elevator pitch?

The elevator pitch is called like that because you should be able to pique the interest of the person you’re talking to about yourself or your project in no more than a brief elevator ride. Done right, this short speech helps you introduce yourself to career connections in a compelling way.
Keep in mind that the objective of this speech is not to sell but to make your project interesting, get another interview further ahead.

### What's in an elevator pitch?

This speech is all about you: who you are, what you do, and what you want to do (if you're job hunting).  
Your elevator pitch is a way to share your expertise and credentials quickly and effectively with people who don't know you.  
If you’re trying to get investors for a project, it has to include the right information about it to make it interesting.  

### When and how to use an elevator pitch

If you're job searching, you can use your elevator pitch at job fairs and career expos, and online in your LinkedIn summary or Twitter bio.  
You can also use your elevator pitch to introduce yourself at networking events and mixers. If you're attending professional association programs and events, or any other type of gathering, have your pitch ready to share with those you meet.  
Your elevator pitch can be used during job interviews, especially when you're asked about yourself. Should an interviewer ask something like "Tell me about yourself" think of your elevator pitch as a super-condensed version of your response to that request.

## Creating an elevator pitch  
  
It can take some time to get your pitch right. You'll likely go through several versions before finding one that is compelling, and that sounds natural in conversation.  
  
**1. Identify your goal**  
Start by thinking about the objective of your pitch.  
Do you want to tell potential clients about your organization? Do you have a great new product idea that you want to pitch to an executive? Or do you want a simple and engaging speech to explain what you do for a living?  
  
**2. Explain what you do**  
Start your pitch by describing what your organization does. Focus on the problems that you solve and how you help people. 
Ask yourself this question as you start writing: what do you want your audience to remember most about you?  
Keep in mind that your pitch should excite you first; after all, if you don't get excited about what you're saying, neither will your audience. People may not remember everything that you say, but they will likely remember your enthusiasm.  
  
**3. Communicate your USP and explain your business model**  
How are you going to make money?  
Why is it going to be a success?  
Your elevator pitch also needs to communicate your unique selling proposition , or USP.  
Identify what makes you, your organization, or your idea, unique. You'll want to communicate your USP after you've talked about what you do.  
  
**4. Put it all together**  
When you've completed each section of your pitch, put it all together.  
Then, read it aloud and use a stopwatch to time how long it takes. It should be no longer than 60 seconds. Otherwise you risk losing the person's interest, or monopolizing the conversation.  
Then, try to cut out anything doesn't absolutely need to be there. Remember, your pitch needs to be compelling, so the shorter it is, the better!  
  
**5. Practice**  
Like anything else, practice makes perfect. Remember, how you say it is just as important as what you say. If you don't practice, it's likely that you'll talk too fast, sound unnatural, or forget important elements of your pitch.  
Set a goal to practice your pitch regularly. The more you practice, the more natural your pitch will become. You want it to sound like a smooth conversation, not an aggressive sales pitch.  
Make sure that you're aware of your body language  as you talk, which conveys just as much information to the listener as your words do. Practice in front of a mirror or, better yet, in front of colleagues until the pitch feels natural.  
 

## Tips

### How to make your elevator pitch better  
  
  

**Your elevator pitch should be brief.** As said before, you should restrict it at 60 seconds max. You don't need to include your entire work history and career objectives.  

**You need to be persuasive.** Even though it's a short pitch, your elevator speech should be persuasive enough to spark the listener's interest in your idea, organization, or background.  

**Share your skills.** Your elevator pitch should explain who you are and what qualifications and skills you have. Try to focus on assets that add value in many situations. Share what you bring to the table.   

**Practice.** The best way to get comfortable with an elevator pitch is to practice it until the speed and “pitch” come naturally, without sounding robotic. You will become comfortable varying the conversation as you practice with it. Try saying your speech to a friend, or record it. This will help you know if you are staying within the time limit and giving a coherent message.   

**Mention your goals.** You don't need to get too specific. An overly targeted goal isn't helpful, since your pitch will be used in many circumstances, and with many different types of people. But do remember to say what you're looking for. For instance, you might say, "a role in accounting" or "an opportunity to apply my sales skills to a new market" or "to relocate to San Francisco with a job in this same industry."   

**Know your audience, and speak to them.** Adapt your language to make the speech appealing for the kind of audience you have. You don’t want to approach someone who really knows nothing about the industry than the same way you would do it with an expert. Remember to tailor your pitch for different audiences, if appropriate.  

### What not to say and do during your elevator pitch

**Don't speak too fast.** Yes, you only have a short time to convey a lot of information. But don't try to fix this by speaking quickly. This will just make it hard for listeners to absorb your message.  

**Avoid rambling.** This is why it's so important to practice your elevator speech.
While you don't want to over-rehearse, and subsequently sound stilted, you also don't want to have unfocused or unclear sentences in your pitch, or get off-track. 
 
**Don't speak in a monotone.** Here's one of the downsides to rehearsing: it can leave you more focused on remembering the exact words you want to use, and less on how you're carrying yourself. Keep your energy level high, positive, and enthusiastic. Modulate your voice to keep listeners interested, and keep your facial expression friendly.
